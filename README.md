# OCR
Implementation of a CNN for OCR that allows you to upload your own images to recognize handwritten digits.

Refer to sklearn_ocr.ipynb for the code to train the model and export the trained model as a package.
Refer to sklearn_ocr_test.ipynb to learn how to build a tester that recognizes digits from your own uploaded images.

PS: The model was trained using Azure Notebooks, so you may need to download the MNIST dataset on your local machine to replicate the 
training and testing.
